# electron-mapzen-app

A template Electron-based Mapzen API application. Mostly just the basic scaffolding for a simple app with hooks for toggling between multiple Mapzen API keys.

Too soon. Move along.

## Install

First of all you will need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. On a Mac these are all easy to install with the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager. On Linux all the dependencies are available via tools like `apt` or `yum`. On Windows I'm afraid I have no idea what the state of the art is these days.

Once all the dependencies are installed:

```
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/whosonfirst/electron-mapzen-app

# Go into the repository
cd electron-mapzen-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the app
npm start
```
